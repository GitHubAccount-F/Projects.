Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

I added a method called containsNode() that checks if a graph contains a certain node. I did
this to quickly check if a graph has a certain node rather than searching through a whole list of nodes.
This helped in finding cases where an unknown Marvel character was given.
