#Tests Dijkstra's algorithm with a graph containing only three
#nodes, in a straight line path

#Creates the graph
created graph graph1

#Adds the nodes
added node one to graph1
added node two to graph1
added node three to graph1

#Add edge
added edge 10.000 from one to two in graph1
added edge 10.000 from two to one in graph1
added edge 10.000 from two to three in graph1
added edge 10.000 from three to two in graph1

#Finds a path
path from one to two:
one to two with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000

path from three to one:
three to two with weight 10.000
two to one with weight 10.000
total cost: 20.000
