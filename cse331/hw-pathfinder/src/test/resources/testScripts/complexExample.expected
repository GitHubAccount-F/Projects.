#Finds the least costly paths
path from three to six:
no path found

path from five to two:
five to three with weight 4.000
three to one with weight 4.000
one to two with weight 4.000
total cost: 12.000

path from four to five:
four to five with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000

path from two to one:
two to one with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
