#Tests that ListChildren works with nodes of type double

#Creates graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3

#Adds nodes
added node one to graph1
added node two to graph1

added node one to graph2
added node two to graph2

added node one to graph3
added node two to graph3
added node three to graph3

#Adds edges
added edge 5.000 from one to two in graph1

added edge 5.000 from one to two in graph2
added edge 4.000 from one to two in graph2

added edge 5.000 from one to two in graph3
added edge 7.351 from one to two in graph3
added edge 44.901 from one to two in graph3
added edge 70.000 from one to three in graph3

#List the child nodes
the children of one in graph1 are: two(5.000)
the children of one in graph2 are: two(4.000) two(5.000)
the children of one in graph3 are: three(70.000) two(5.000) two(7.351) two(44.901)
