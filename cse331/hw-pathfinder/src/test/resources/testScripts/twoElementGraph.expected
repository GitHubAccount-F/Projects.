#Tests Dijkstra's algorithm with a graph containing only two
#nodes

#Creates the graph
created graph graph1

#Adds the nodes
added node one to graph1
added node two to graph1

#Adds edge
added edge 10.000 from one to two in graph1
added edge 10.000 from two to one in graph1

#Finds a path
path from one to two:
one to two with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000

path from two to one:
two to one with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000
