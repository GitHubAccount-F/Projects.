#Tests to see if a node can have an edge point to
#itself, has a bidirectional edge with multiple nodes,
#has a child node, and has a parent node.

#Creates an empty graph
created graph graph1

#Adds nodes
added node a to graph1
added node b to graph1
added node c to graph1
added node d to graph1
added node e to graph1

#Adds edges
added edge e1 from a to a in graph1
added edge e2 from a to b in graph1
added edge e3 from a to c in graph1
added edge e4 from a to d in graph1
added edge e5 from e to a in graph1
added edge e6 from b to a in graph1
added edge e7 from c to a in graph1

#Checks the child nodes to confirm test.
#a forms bi-directional edges with b and c,
#e is the parent node of a,
#and d is the child node of a.
the children of a in graph1 are: a(e1) b(e2) c(e3) d(e4)
the children of b in graph1 are: a(e6)
the children of c in graph1 are: a(e7)
the children of d in graph1 are:
the children of e in graph1 are: a(e5)

#Lists the nodes
graph1 contains: a b c d e
