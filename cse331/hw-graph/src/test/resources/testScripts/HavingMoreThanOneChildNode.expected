#Tests to see if a parent node can have multiple child nodes

#Creates empty graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3

#Adds multiple nodes
added node one to graph1
added node one to graph2
added node two to graph2
added node one to graph3
added node two to graph3
added node three to graph3

#Creates multiple edges
added edge e1 from one to two in graph2
added edge e1 from one to two in graph3
added edge e1 from one to three in graph3

#Checks to see if there are multiple child nodes
the children of one in graph1 are:
the children of one in graph2 are: two(e1)
the children of one in graph3 are: three(e1) two(e1)
