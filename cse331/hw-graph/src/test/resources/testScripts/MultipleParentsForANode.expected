#Tests to see that a node
#can have multiple parent nodes.
#We also test that this works when a node is
#in between two other nodes.

#Creates empty graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3
created graph graph4

#Adds a node
added node one to graph2
added node two to graph2
added node one to graph3
added node two to graph3
added node three to graph3
added node one to graph4
added node two to graph4
added node three to graph4
added node four to graph4

#Adds edges
added edge e1 from one to two in graph2
added edge e1 from one to two in graph3
added edge e1 from three to two in graph3
added edge e1 from one to three in graph4
added edge e2 from two to three in graph4
added edge e3 from three to four in graph4

#Gives information about child nodes, which can use to then see
#how many parents a node has
the children of one in graph1 are:
the children of one in graph2 are: two(e1)
the children of one in graph3 are: two(e1)
the children of three in graph3 are: two(e1)
the children of one in graph4 are: three(e1)
the children of two in graph4 are: three(e2)
the children of three in graph4 are: four(e3)
