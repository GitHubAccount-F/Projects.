#Tests to see that when adding an edge between
#two nodes, that if the edge is already present, then
#it won't be added.

#Creates empty graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3

#Adds nodes to graphs
added node one to graph1
added node two to graph1
added node one to graph2
added node two to graph2
added node one to graph3
added node two to graph3

#Adds the edge
added edge e1 from one to two in graph1
added edge e1 from one to two in graph2
added edge e1 from one to two in graph2
added edge e1 from one to two in graph3
added edge e1 from one to two in graph3
added edge e2 from one to two in graph3

#Check to see if edge was added
the children of one in graph1 are: two(e1)
the children of one in graph2 are: two(e1)
the children of one in graph3 are: two(e1) two(e2)
