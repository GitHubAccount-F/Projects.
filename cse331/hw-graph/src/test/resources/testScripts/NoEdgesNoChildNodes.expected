#Tests to that a node with no edges has no
#child node(s). Also tests that this applies
#to any nodes that are child nodes of other nodes.

#Creates empty graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3
created graph graph4

#Adds nodes
added node one to graph1
added node one to graph2
added node two to graph2
added node one to graph3
added node two to graph3
added node three to graph3
added node one to graph4
added node two to graph4

#Create an edge
added edge e1 from one to two in graph4

#Checks to see the child node
