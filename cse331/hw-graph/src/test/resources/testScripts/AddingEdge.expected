#Tests to see if edges were added properly between two nodes

#Creates empty graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

#Adds nodes to graphs
added node one to graph1
added node two to graph1
added node one to graph2
added node two to graph2

#Lists the nodes
graph1 contains: one two
graph2 contains: one two

#Adds the edge(s)
added edge e1 from one to two in graph2

#Check to see if edges were added
the children of one in graph1 are:
the children of one in graph2 are: two(e1)
