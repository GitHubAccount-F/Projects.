#Tests to see if we can create a chain of nodes.
#For example, A-->B-->C-->A

#Creates an empty graph
CreateGraph graph1

#Adds nodes
AddNode graph1 one
AddNode graph1 two
AddNode graph1 three

#Creates edges
AddEdge graph1 one two e1
AddEdge graph1 two three e2
AddEdge graph1 three one e1

#Lists the nodes
ListNodes graph1

#Lists the child nodes, where we should
#be able to tell that their is a chain present
ListChildren graph1 one
ListChildren graph1 two
ListChildren graph1 three
