#This tests that when adding multiple nodes
#with the same label inside of a graph,
#it will only keep the first that was added
#and disregard any other attempts at adding a similar one

#Creates empty graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2
created graph graph3

#Adds nodes to graphs
added node one to graph1
added node one to graph2
added node one to graph2
added node one to graph3
added node one to graph3
added node ONE to graph3

#Checks nodes inside of a graph
